## How To Contribute

This project uses Xamarin Studio Community Edition on Mac. 

1. Install Xamarin and Xcode
2. Clone and pull down the project from Github. 
3. Branch hotfixes from `master` and branch new features from `develop` following gitflow.
4. Submit a merge request for review.

Since this project is a casual learning hobby, I do not expect to receive a high volume of contributions. I will however review issues and merge requests.

Only the Android project is complete at this point.
